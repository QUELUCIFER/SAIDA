  <h3># History of SAIDA</h3>  
  <p>There is an Algorithm Contest in Samsung SDS every year. It's a developer's festival and last year('17), the subject was "Starcraft". Lots of developers participated in this festival and the contest was successful. After the contest, some developers who had a good grade in the contest gathered to make worldwide champion bot. They proposed this idea to the company and fortunately it is accepted. That is a start of 'SAIDA'. It started in January, 2018 with 8 developers.
